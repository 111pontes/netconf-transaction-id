# Introduction

When a NETCONF client connects with a NETCONF server, a frequently 
occurring use case is for the client to find out if the configuration 
has changed since it was last connected.  Such changes could occur for 
example if another NETCONF client has made changes, or another system 
or operator made changes through other means than NETCONF.

One way of detecting a change for a client would be to 
retrieve the entire configuration from the server, then compare 
the result with a previously stored copy at the client side.  This 
approach is not popular with most NETCONF users, however, since it 
would often be very expensive in terms of communications and 
computation cost.

> Internal comment    
  Evidence of this feature being demanded by clients is that numerous 
  server implementors have built proprietary and mutually incompatible 
  mechanisms for obtaining a transaction id from a NETCONF server.

RESTCONF, RFC 8040 [RFC8040](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8040), 
defines a mechanism for detecting changes in configuration subtrees 
based on Entity-tags (ETags).  In conjunction with this, RESTCONF 
provides a way to make configuration changes conditional on the server
confiuguration being untouched by others. This mechanism leverages 
RFC 7232 [RFC7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232) 
"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests".

This document defines similar functionality for NETCONF, 
RFC 6241 [RFC6241](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6241).

# Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Configuration Tagging

> Internal comment    
  This is based on RFC 8040. Is there a way to avoid duplication?

## Entity-Tags Encoding

Entity-tags are opaque base64 encoded strings that represent a 
particular configuration state for a configuration datastore subtree.  
Servers SHOULD ensure that the probability for two different 
configurations having the same Entity-tag value is extremely small.

Implementations are RECOMMENDED to implement entity-tags by computing
a hash over the configuration subtree.

## Timestamps Encoding

Timestamps are ISO 8601 
[ISO8601](https://www.iso.org/standard/70907.html) 
encoded strings in UTC timezone that represent the last time the
element or any of its descendent elements had the configuration 
changed.  Servers SHOULD ensure that the server's clock is reasonably
accurate.

## Behavior

The server SHOULD maintain an entity-tag and timestamp for each YANG 
container and list that represents configuration, but servers are 
allowed to not implement the entity-tags and timestamps for all 
such containers and lists.  Entity-tags and timestamps as defined 
in this document MUST NOT be present on non-configuration elements.

For YANG elements where an entity-tag and timestamp is maintained, 
the server MUST return an entity-tag and timestamp when the element is
retrieved using the get-config, edit-config or edit-data operations.  

The element entity-tag and timestamp MUST be updated whenever the 
container or list itself, or any descendant configuration element is
altered, regardless of wheter such a change was initiated over
NETCONF or other means.  The entity-tag MUST NOT be updated due to 
changes in non-configuration elements.  

## Entity-Tag Protocol Usage

> Internal comment    
  There are two different proposals here, Attribute- and Leaf- based.
  We have to pick one.

### Attribute-based variant

The entity-tags and timestamps are conveyed by the server to the client
as XML attributes on container and list instances in the output. The 
attributes' XML namespace MUST be the ietf-netconf-transaction-id 
YANG module's namespace.

A client might send the following get-config request:
~~~
<rpc xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="1">
  <get-config>
    <source>
      <running/>
    </source>
    <filter>
      <interfaces xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-interfaces"/>
    </filter>
  </get-config>
</rpc>
~~~

To this, a server implementing ietf-netconf-transaction-id might 
respond:
~~~
<rpc-reply message-id="1"
           xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
  <data>
    <interfaces xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-interfaces"
                ietf-netconf-transaction-id:entag="abc12345678"
                ietf-netconf-transaction-id:timestamp="2020-10-01T12:33:50Z">
      <interface ietf-netconf-transaction-id:entag="def88884321"
                 ietf-netconf-transaction-id:timestamp="2020-10-01T12:33:50Z">
        <name>GigabitEthernet-0/0/0</name>
        <description>Management Interface</description>
        <type>ianaift:ethernetCsmacd</type>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
      </interface>
      <interface ietf-netconf-transaction-id:entag="ghi77775678"
                 ietf-netconf-transaction-id:timestamp="2020-08-12T00:16:11Z">
        <name>GigabitEthernet-0/0/1</name>
        <description>Upward Interface</description>
        <type>ianaift:ethernetCsmacd</type>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
      </interface>
    </interfaces>
  </data>
</rpc>
~~~

The "entag" attribute values in the example above are meant to 
represent hash values, computed over the configuration of each
element and its descendants.

### Leaf-based variant

The entity-tags and timestamps are conveyed by the server to the client
as XML tags in the rpc-reply.  The tags' XML namespace MUST be the 
ietf-netconf-transaction-id YANG module's namespace.

A client might send the following get-config request:
~~~
<rpc xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="1">
  <get-config>
    <source>
      <running/>
    </source>
    <filter>
      <interfaces xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-interfaces"/>
    </filter>
  </get-config>
</rpc>
~~~

To this, a server implementing ietf-netconf-transaction-id might 
respond:
~~~
<rpc-reply message-id="1"
           xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
  <ietf-netconf-transaction-id:entag="abc12345678"/>
  <ietf-netconf-transaction-id:timestamp="2020-10-01T12:33:50Z"/>
  <data>
    <interfaces xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-interfaces"
      <interface>
        <name>GigabitEthernet-0/0/0</name>
        <description>Management Interface</description>
        <type>ianaift:ethernetCsmacd</type>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
      </interface>
      <interface>
        <name>GigabitEthernet-0/0/1</name>
        <description>Upward Interface</description>
        <type>ianaift:ethernetCsmacd</type>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
      </interface>
    </interfaces>
  </data>
</rpc>
~~~

The "entag" tag values in the example above are meant to represent 
hash values, computed over the configuration subtree.

# Conditional Transactions

The "ETag" header field can be used by a RESTCONF client in
subsequent requests, within the "If-Match" and "If-None-Match" header
fields.


> Internal comment        
                        Currently we have two different approaches to solving
                        this.  We have to pick one.
                        This is the "attribute-based approach"






   This entity-tag is only affected by configuration data resources and
   MUST NOT be updated for changes to non-configuration data.  If the
   RESTCONF server is co-located with a NETCONF server, then the
   entity-tag for a configuration data resource MUST represent the
   instance within the "running" datastore.



# Get-config with Maximum Depth





3.4.1.2.  Entity-Tag

   The server MUST maintain a unique opaque entity-tag for the datastore
   resource and MUST return it in the "ETag" (Section 2.3 of 
   [RFC7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232))
   header in the response for a retrieval request.  The client MAY use
   an "If-Match" header in edit operation requests to cause the server
   to reject the request if the resource entity-tag does not match the
   specified value.

   The server MUST maintain an entity-tag for the top-level
   {+restconf}/data resource.  This entity-tag is only affected by
   configuration data resources and MUST NOT be updated for changes to
   non-configuration data.  Entity-tags for data resources are discussed
   in Section 3.5.  Note that each representation (e.g., XML vs. JSON)
   requires a different entity-tag.

   If the RESTCONF server is co-located with a NETCONF server, then this
   entity-tag MUST be for the "running" datastore.  Note that it is
   possible that other protocols can cause the entity-tag to be updated.
   Such mechanisms are out of scope for this document.

3.4.1.3.  Update Procedure

   Changes to configuration data resources affect the timestamp and
   entity-tag for that resource, any ancestor data resources, and the
   datastore resource.

   For example, an edit to disable an interface might be done by setting
   the leaf "/interfaces/interface/enabled" to "false".  The "enabled"
   data node and its ancestors (one "interface" list instance, and the
   "interfaces" container) are considered to be changed.  The datastore
   is considered to be changed when any top-level configuration data
   node is changed (e.g., "interfaces").




   The "Last-Modified" header field can be used by a RESTCONF client in
   subsequent requests, within the "If-Modified-Since" and
   "If-Unmodified-Since" header fields.

   If maintained, the resource timestamp MUST be set to the current time
   whenever the resource or any configuration resource within the
   resource is altered.  If not maintained, then the resource timestamp
   for the datastore MUST be used instead.  If the RESTCONF server is
   co-located with a NETCONF server, then the last-modified timestamp
   for a configuration data resource MUST represent the instance within
   the "running" datastore.

   This timestamp is only affected by configuration data resources and
   MUST NOT be updated for changes to non-configuration data.

3.5.2.  Entity-Tag

   For configuration data resources, the server SHOULD maintain a
   resource entity-tag for each resource and return the "ETag" header
   field when it is retrieved as the target resource with the GET or
   HEAD methods.  If maintained, the resource entity-tag MUST be updated
   whenever the resource or any configuration resource within the
   resource is altered.  If not maintained, then the resource entity-tag
   for the datastore MUST be used instead.

   The "ETag" header field can be used by a RESTCONF client in
   subsequent requests, within the "If-Match" and "If-None-Match" header
   fields.
